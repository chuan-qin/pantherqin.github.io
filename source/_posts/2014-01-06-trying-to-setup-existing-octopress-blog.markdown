Have been trying to setup the blog (using rsync) from a fresh installation of Linux Mint on my E6510. Well, this might be the only laptop available for me in the coming month or two.

####Notes:
1, try to install ruby 2.1.0 using rvm, and use it as default.

2, gem install bundle has issues when ruby 1.9.3 was used instead. (at least on my comp)

~~3, strangely I found out that in Linux Mint, .bashrc doesn't automatically include .bash_profile. That is really.....weired. (or maybe I accidentally removed the linkage?)~~

This is me being stupid and ignorant...
[.bashrc & .bash_profile](http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html)
