###Take aways from Angelina Fabbro's JSConf presentation

*[Angelina Fabbro : Javascript Masterclass]*

Ask yourself constantly “WHY?”. Not only in programming or while reading others code, also in life, in everyday life you need to consistantly question yourself of what/how/what-if-not

racklessly experiment your code!

HAVE a stand(opinion).

Seek mentorship.

Learn to write in other lanugage. At least for a little bit.

Think like a programmer.
